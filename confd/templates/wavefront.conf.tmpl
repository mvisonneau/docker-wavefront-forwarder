#
# The prefix should either be left undefined, or can be any  prefix you want
#    prepended to all data points coming from this agent (such as 'prod').
#
# Examples:
#
#    #prefix=
#    prefix=prod.nyc
#

prefix={{ getenv "PREFIX" }}

# The server should be either the primary Wavefront cloud server, or your custom VPC address.
#   This will be provided to you by Wavefront.
#
server={{ getenv "SERVER" }}

# The hostname will be used to identify the internal agent statistics around point rates, JVM info, etc.
#  We strongly recommend setting this to a name that is unique among your entire infrastructure,
#   possibly including the datacenter information, etc. This hostname does not need to correspond to
#   any actual hostname or DNS entry; it's merely a string that we pass with the internal stats.
#
hostname={{ getenv "HOSTNAME" }}

# The Token is any valid API Token for your account, which can be generated from the gear icon
#   at the top right of the Wavefront site, under 'Settings'. Paste that hexadecimal token
#   after the '=' below, and the agent will automatically generate a machine-specific UUID and
#   self-register.
# If you don't set this token here, you can still register the agent through the normal web flow.
#
token={{ getenv "TOKEN" }}

# Which ports to listen on, with separate threads for each listener. Typically 2878.
#    For each port, numCores threads will be started. So if you have a single port listed, but
#    are running on a 4-core machine, 4 threads will be started.
pushListenerPorts=2878

# Max points per flush. Typically 40000.
pushFlushMaxPoints=40000

# Milliseconds between flushes to the Wavefront servers. Typically 1000.
pushFlushInterval=1000

# If there are blocked points, how many lines to print to the log every 10 flushes. Typically 5.
pushBlockedSamples=5

# The push log level determines how much information will be printed to the log.
#   Options: NONE, SUMMARY, DETAILED. Typically SUMMARY.
pushLogLevel=SUMMARY

# The validation level keeps certain data from being sent to Wavefront.
#   We strongly recommend keeping this at NUMERIC_ONLY
#   Options: NUMERIC_ONLY, NO_VALIDATION.
pushValidationLevel=NUMERIC_ONLY


## Which ports should listen for collectd/graphite-formatted data?
## If you uncomment graphitePorts, make sure to uncomment and set 'graphiteFormat' and 'graphiteDelimiters' as well.
graphitePorts=2003

## Which fields (1-based) should we extract and concatenate (with dots) as the hostname?
graphiteFormat=2

## Which characters should be replaced by dots in the hostname, after extraction?
graphiteDelimiters=_
